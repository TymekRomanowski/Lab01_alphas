### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
plastic_waste <- read_csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

### Exercise 1

*As expected the highest plastic waste per capita is in Europe and the lowest in South America, it is beacause of the population differences and development of the continents.*

```{r plastic-waste-continent}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) +facet_wrap(~ continent)
```

### Exercise 2

```{r plastic-waste-density}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.01)
```

### Exercise 3

*Colour and fill mappings are globally defined so that they are applied by default to any geom functions. Alpha is mapped locally so that it only applies to that specific geom_density function, and is not global. *

### Exercise 4

*Violin plot gives approximate visualisation of the density of each individual variable, the boxplot only generally gives an idea of where the highest peak and median of the data is .*

```{r plastic-waste-violin}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_violin()

ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
